overrides are like injectors to a chart
should probably support anything we allow in here in a chart
but since I want to be able to just drop a good set of popular
charts in, this deals with all their hardcoded stuff

the format is:

[{time: float, eventtype: str, attributes?: {attrname: any}}, ...]

which would generate an object like:

EventType(ChartEvent):
    time: float = time
    for k, v in attributes:
        setattr(self, k, v)

if eventtype is in a list of known events, it will make that event,
if not just make a GenericChartEvent or something with the eventtype
as an attribute
